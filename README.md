GUI maze game in which players navigate through maze by succesfully answering tivia questions. Incorrect answers pemenantly close doors. 
Correct answers open doors. Game is won when player navigates to exit (bottom right room). Game is lost when no path exists to exit.

Program features starting and stopping various games while program is running. Serialization provides ability to access saved games after program closed and reopened.

Originally designed as a group project (of 3 members) for a university course with a more monolithic, non-modular design. 
Personally redesigned to use the Model-View-Controler design pattern and the Observer design pattern.
Additionally replaced components of program originally implememntd by group members with personal implementation.
